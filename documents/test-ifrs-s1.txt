IFRS S1: General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information

Overview:
IFRS S1 establishes the general requirements for disclosure of sustainability-related financial information. It provides a comprehensive framework for entities to report on sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

Key Requirements:
1. An entity must disclose material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects.
2. Information must be disclosed alongside related financial statements for the same reporting period.
3. Disclosures must be structured using the four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.
4. The entity must apply judgment to determine what information is material.

Relationship with IFRS S2:
IFRS S1 provides the overarching framework and general requirements for all sustainability disclosures. IFRS S2 (Climate-related Disclosures) is a specific application of IFRS S1's principles, focusing specifically on climate-related risks and opportunities. IFRS S2 builds upon and supplements the general requirements in IFRS S1.

Governance Requirements:
An entity must disclose the governance processes, controls, and procedures it uses to monitor and manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

Strategy Requirements:
An entity must disclose how sustainability-related risks and opportunities are integrated into its strategy and business model.

Risk Management Requirements:
An entity must disclose the processes it uses to identify, assess, and manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities.
