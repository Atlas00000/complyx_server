IFRS S2: Climate-related Disclosures

Overview:
IFRS S2 requires an entity to disclose information about climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's cash flows, its access to finance, or cost of capital over the short, medium, or long term.

Key Requirements:
1. An entity must disclose material information about climate-related physical risks and transition risks.
2. Information about climate-related opportunities must be disclosed when material.
3. Disclosures must follow the four pillars structure established in IFRS S1: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.
4. The entity must disclose its climate-related targets and progress toward meeting those targets.

Relationship with IFRS S1:
IFRS S2 is a specific application of IFRS S1's general requirements. It focuses specifically on climate-related disclosures while applying the same four-pillar structure and materiality concepts from IFRS S1. Entities must comply with both IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 when disclosing climate-related information.

Climate-Related Risks:
An entity must disclose information about:
- Physical risks (acute and chronic)
- Transition risks (policy, legal, technology, market, and reputational risks)
- How these risks affect the entity's strategy and business model

Climate-Related Opportunities:
An entity must disclose information about climate-related opportunities when material, such as:
- Resource efficiency
- Energy sources
- Products, services, and markets
- Resilience

Metrics and Targets:
An entity must disclose:
- Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions
- Climate-related targets and how they relate to broader climate goals
- Progress toward meeting climate-related targets
